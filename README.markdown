This is the Microsoft assembly for the .Net 4.0 Dynamic language functionality.

I am in no way taking ownership of this assembly!  I'm am simply making it available since it seems very hard to find.  I've also created a NuGet package so it's easy to import into your Visual Studio projects.  You can install it via NuGet with this command in the Nuget Package Manager:

install-package System.Linq.Dynamic

Documentation and Samples

You can find sample code and documentation on usage from this link, just Accept the terms and you will download a Visual Studio file with C# code and HTML documentation.
